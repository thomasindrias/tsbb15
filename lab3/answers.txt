-Use Harris detector to find points.
-Image patch intensity matching
There are 8 unknown variables in transformation matrix so we need n >= 8.

3
We must be able to find corresponding points between the two images.

4.1
Use SIFT to find correspondences.
+ It's more accurate than many other descriptors
+ Scale and rotation invariant
- SIFT is more mathematically complicated and computationally heavy

4.2
Calculates the distances between the epipolar lines and the supplied points.

4.3
Done on code

4.4
value of 1.0

4.5
2000 iterations.

5.1
Done on code

5.2
Yes, most of the times the epipolar lines on image 1 stay on the same features in image 2.

5.3
With our current iterations used in ransac, Gold-Standard algorithm is much faster
(about 41 times).
